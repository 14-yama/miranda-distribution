To calculate how much USD Mrs. Francis will need to pay based on the invoice total and Miranda Distribution Limited's buying rate, you can follow these steps:

Convert the total invoice amount from your currency to USD using the buying rate.
Total Invoice Amount: $1,020.00
Miranda's Buying Rate: 6.6013 USD for 1 Currency Unit (let's assume 1 Currency Unit is your local currency)

Amount in USD = Total Invoice Amount / Buying Rate
Amount in USD = $1,020.00 / 6.6013 ≈ $154.50

So, Mrs. Francis will need to pay approximately $154.50 USD based on the provided information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To calculate how much Miranda Distribution Limited will receive from selling the USD obtained from Mrs. Francis's payment, and to determine the profit and percentage profit, you can follow these steps:

Calculate the amount in local currency obtained from Mrs. Francis's payment:

USD Amount: $154.50
Selling Rate: 7.35 (local currency per USD)

Amount in Local Currency = USD Amount × Selling Rate
Amount in Local Currency = $154.50 × 7.35 ≈ $1136.475

Calculate the profit:

Profit = Amount in Local Currency - Invoice Amount in Local Currency
Profit = $1136.475 - $1020.00 = $116.475

Calculate the profit percentage:

Profit Percentage = (Profit / Invoice Amount in Local Currency) × 100
Profit Percentage = ($116.475 / $1020.00) × 100 ≈ 11.42%

So, by selling the USD on FOREX at a rate of 7.35 local currency per USD, Miranda Distribution Limited will receive approximately $1136.475 in local currency. The profit from this transaction will be around $116.475, which represents a profit percentage of about 11.42% based on the invoice amount in the local currency.

Sure, let's update the scenario considering the new payment and trading details:

Payment from Mrs. Francis (in XCD):

Mrs. Francis pays in XCD (Eastern Caribbean Dollars).
Miranda buys XCD at a rate of 2.2 XCD for 1 local currency unit.
Miranda's USD Purchase from Mrs. Francis:

Miranda buys USD from Mrs. Francis using the received XCD.
Miranda's buying rate for USD from Mrs. Francis is 2.7 XCD for 1 USD.
Miranda's FOREX Sale:

Miranda sells the USD obtained from Mrs. Francis on FOREX.
Miranda sells USD on FOREX at a rate of 7.35 local currency units (TTD) per USD.
Let's calculate the amounts and profits for both scenarios:

Invoice Amount in Local Currency (TTD): $1020.00

Mrs. Francis Pays in XCD:

Amount in XCD from Mrs. Francis:

Invoice Amount in TTD: $1020.00
Buying Rate (Miranda buys XCD): 2.2 XCD for 1 TTD

Amount in XCD = Invoice Amount in TTD / Buying Rate
Amount in XCD = $1020.00 / 2.2 ≈ $463.64 XCD

USD Obtained from Mrs. Francis:

USD Amount = Amount in XCD / Miranda's Buying Rate (2.7 XCD for 1 USD)
USD Amount = $463.64 XCD / 2.7 ≈ $171.69 USD

Miranda's FOREX Sale (USD to TTD):

Selling Rate on FOREX: 7.35 TTD for 1 USD

Amount in TTD from FOREX Sale = USD Amount × Selling Rate
Amount in TTD from FOREX Sale = $171.69 USD × 7.35 ≈ $1264.02 TTD

Profit from FOREX Sale:

Profit in TTD = Amount in TTD from FOREX Sale - Invoice Amount in TTD
Profit in TTD = $1264.02 TTD - $1020.00 TTD = $244.02 TTD

Comparison for both USD and XCD Payments:

USD Payment (Previous Scenario):

Profit: $116.475 TTD
Profit Percentage: 11.42%
XCD Payment (Current Scenario):

Profit: $244.02 TTD
As you can see, in this scenario, by receiving payment in XCD, converting to USD, and selling USD on FOREX, Miranda Distribution Limited achieves a higher profit of $244.02 TTD compared to the USD payment scenario.
