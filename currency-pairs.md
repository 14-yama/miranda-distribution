## Forex Notation Explanation:

Forex notation is a standardized way of expressing exchange rates between two currencies. It consists of a currency pair and an exchange rate. Here's how it works:

1. **Currency Pair:**
   - In forex notation, a currency pair is denoted by three letters. The first two letters represent the base currency, and the last letter represents the quote currency. For example:
  
     | Currency Pair | Base Currency | Quote Currency |
     |:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
     | GYD/TTD       | GYD (Guyanese Dollar) | TTD (Trinidad and Tobago Dollar) |
     | XCD/TTD       | XCD (Eastern Caribbean Dollar) | TTD (Trinidad and Tobago Dollar) |

2. **Exchange Rate:**
   - The exchange rate indicates how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. Using the example "XCD/TTD = 2.2," it means that 1 Eastern Caribbean Dollar (XCD) can be exchanged for 2.2 Trinidad and Tobago Dollars (TTD).

So, in general terms:

\[ \text{Currency Pair / Exchange Rate} \]

### Exchange Rate Tables:

#### GYD/TTD Exchange Rate
| GYD (Base) | TTD (Quote) | Exchange Rate |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| 1          | 0.0339      | GYD/TTD = 0.0339 |

#### XCD/TTD Exchange Rate
| XCD (Base) | TTD (Quote) | Exchange Rate |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| 1          | 2.2         | XCD/TTD = 2.2  |

Understanding forex notation is essential for traders and investors to interpret exchange rates and make informed decisions in the foreign exchange market. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with, feel free to let me know!
