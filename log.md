## 4th Oct, 2023 F.I.R.E Goal:
Embarking on my F.I.R.E. journey, which commenced on September 9, 2021, my unwavering goal is to achieve financial independence and retire early by my 45th birthday. With seven years remaining in my journey, I'm committed to pursuing diverse objectives, including the construction of an expedition vessel for a globe-circumnavigation adventure and establishing a self-sufficient community for the underprivileged.

In this transformative journey, I am focused on the establishment of independent businesses, with a primary focus on Logistics, Manufacturing & Distribution, and Real Estate. My approach underscores a commitment to automation and outsourcing in all business operations. Work-life balance is paramount, with my flexible work schedule allowing a maximum of 3 days per week, working 4 hours each day.

Understanding the needs of CARICOM students based in Trinidad colleges, my objective is to deliver a personalized logistics service, ensuring the smooth receipt of their personal items from their home countries. Additionally, I plan to facilitate direct orders for automotive parts and dry goods to meet the consistent demand from Trinidad to Grenada and St. Vincent.

In the Manufacturing & Distribution sector, I aim to produce and distribute dehydrated fruits to local supermarkets in Trinidad. Employing a niche market strategy, I intend to promote these products to children, emphasizing the promotion of healthy eating disguised as enticing snacks.

Real Estate investments will concentrate on acquiring a total of 1 acre of real estate, encompassing properties in Grenada and Guyana. This will be a substantial contribution to my overall financial strategy.

Diversification remains a key principle in my plan. Understanding the unique needs of each territory, I aim to distribute goods exclusive to each region, fostering economic growth and meeting local demands.

To enhance the convenience for clients across territories, I plan to open local bank accounts in XCD, USD, and TTD. These accounts will facilitate seamless transactions and contribute to the overall success of my ventures.

Recognizing the shortage of USD in Trinidad, my strategic approach involves converting all foreign currency into USD. Leveraging this, I plan to engage in the local market by selling USD to businessmen, generating a profitable revenue stream.

Looking ahead, my ultimate financial milestone is to achieve an expected portfolio value of $1,000,000 USD. This will not only provide the means to finance the construction of my 24m Expedition Vessel but also sustain my living expenses during early retirement. Through strategic entrepreneurship and a commitment to financial independence, I aim to craft a future filled with diverse opportunities and achievements.
