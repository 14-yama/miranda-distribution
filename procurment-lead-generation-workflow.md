1. **Visitor Segmentation and Lead Capture**:
   - Visitors to your website are segmented based on their interests and needs (e.g., merchants, truck drivers, students).
   - Lead capture forms are strategically placed on landing pages, requiring visitors to provide relevant information such as name, email, company (if applicable), and procurement requirements.

2. **Lead Qualification Process**:
   - Your team reviews the captured leads to assess their suitability and level of interest in your procurement services.
   - Leads are qualified based on predefined criteria, such as budget, procurement frequency, and specific procurement needs.

3. **Access to Supplier Catalog**:
   - Qualified leads are granted access to the suppliers' catalog within your secure platform, such as Method CRM.
   - Upon qualification, leads receive login credentials or access links to the platform where they can browse the catalog and initiate procurement inquiries.

4. **Supplier Catalog Integration with Method CRM**:
   - The suppliers' catalog is integrated into Method CRM, providing a centralized platform for your team to manage and share product information with qualified leads.
   - The catalog can be organized by supplier, product category, or any other relevant criteria for easy navigation and browsing.

5. **Lead Follow-Up and Engagement**:
   - Your team engages with qualified leads to understand their procurement requirements in more detail.
   - Personalized communication channels, such as email or phone calls, are used to address inquiries, provide additional information, and guide leads through the procurement process.

6. **Procurement Process**:
   - Once leads have identified the desired products from the catalog, your team facilitates the procurement process, including requesting quotes from suppliers, negotiating terms, and finalizing orders.

7. **Supplier Interaction**:
   - Your team acts as an intermediary between qualified leads and suppliers, managing communications, coordinating logistics, and ensuring smooth transactions.

8. **Customer Relationship Management**:
   - Throughout the procurement process, interactions with leads and customers are logged and tracked within Method CRM to maintain a comprehensive record of customer interactions and preferences.
