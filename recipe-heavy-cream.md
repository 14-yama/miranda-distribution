### Homemade Heavy Cream Recipe

1. **Separate the cream**: Use a cream separator to separate the cream from the milk. Collect the cream in a container.

2. **Collect additional milk**: Gather additional whole milk to use for diluting the separated cream.

3. **Mix the cream and milk**: Determine the desired butterfat content for your heavy cream. Add the separated cream to a mixing bowl or container, and gradually pour in the additional milk while stirring continuously. Adjust the amount of milk added based on your preference for richness and creaminess.

4. **Mix thoroughly**: Stir the cream and milk mixture thoroughly until well combined. Use a whisk or blender if necessary to ensure even mixing.

5. **Taste and adjust**: After mixing, taste the homemade heavy cream and assess its texture. If it's too thick or rich, you can add more milk to dilute it further. If it's too thin or lacks richness, you can add more separated cream.

6. **Store and use**: Once mixed to your liking, your homemade heavy cream is ready to use. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until needed.
