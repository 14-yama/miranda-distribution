### Homemade Heavy Cream Recipe

1. **Separate the cream**: Use a cream separator to separate the cream from the milk. Collect the cream in a container.

2. **Collect additional milk**: Gather additional whole milk to use for diluting the separated cream.

3. **Mix the cream and milk**: Determine the desired butterfat content for your heavy cream. Add the separated cream to a mixing bowl or container, and gradually pour in the additional milk while stirring continuously. Adjust the amount of milk added based on your preference for richness and creaminess.

4. **Mix thoroughly**: Stir the cream and milk mixture thoroughly until well combined. Use a whisk or blender if necessary to ensure even mixing.

5. **Taste and adjust**: After mixing, taste the homemade heavy cream and assess its texture. If it's too thick or rich, you can add more milk to dilute it further. If it's too thin or lacks richness, you can add more separated cream.

6. **Store and use**: Once mixed to your liking, your homemade heavy cream is ready to use. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator until needed.

### Formula for Making Heavy Cream

To make heavy cream from the cream you have, follow this formula:

M = (C * B) / (100 - B)

- M is the weight of the additional milk (in grams) needed to dilute the cream.
- C is the weight of the cream you have (in grams).
- B is the desired percentage of butterfat in the heavy cream.

To use the formula:
1. Determine the weight of the cream you have (denoted as C).
2. Decide on the desired percentage of butterfat in your heavy cream (denoted as B).
3. Plug in the values of C and B into the formula to calculate the weight of additional milk (M) needed.
4. Mix the calculated amount of additional milk with the cream to achieve the desired consistency and fat content for heavy cream.

Adjust the ratio of cream to milk according to your preferences for richness and creaminess.
