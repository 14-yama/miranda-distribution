## Log - January 10, 2024: Exploring Milk Sources and Refining Paleta Batches

**Key Developments:**

1. **Milk Supplier for Cheese Production:**
   - Found a supplier offering a 36-liter milk churn for $300.
   - This milk is crucial for extracting heavy cream and making condensed milk.
   - Discovered that Venezuelan producers are also in need of this milk for cheese production, competing with Nestle for local milk supplies.

2. **Paleta Batch Trials:**
   - First batch used store-bought heavy cream and evaporated milk. Initial satisfaction, but the taste turned slightly sour after a few days.
   - Second attempt with store-bought heavy cream and condensed milk resulted in excellent quality, albeit a bit too rich.
   - Upcoming focus on adjusting the heavy cream to condensed milk ratio to balance sweetness.

3. **Raw Milk Extraction:**
   - Purchased raw milk for heavy cream extraction.
   - Extracting heavy cream is currently time-consuming with limited yield. Exploring methods for large-batch extraction or seeking advice from other homemade ice cream makers.

**Next Steps:**
   - Conduct a batch using the extracted heavy cream and condensed milk to refine the flavor profile.
   - Investigate better popsicle molds, with stainless steel as a recommended option.
   - Explore efficient methods for large-scale heavy cream extraction to meet production demands.

# Reflection:

As I continue to refine my paleta recipe, the goal is to achieve a balance of flavors and textures, ensuring a high-quality product for future distribution and sales. The challenges in heavy cream extraction highlight the need for streamlined processes to scale up production efficiently. The pursuit of excellence in ingredient sourcing and recipe formulation remains a priority, laying the foundation for a successful venture into the Mexican paleta market.
