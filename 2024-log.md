### October 22, 2024: Banana Supply Stability (BSS) Program Challenges and Passion Fruit Campaign Launch

**Key Developments:**

1. **Banana Supply Stability (BSS) Program**:
   - Received a lead from Foodland Supermarket requesting 3,000 lbs of bananas.
   - Initially proposed 2,700 lbs, then submitted a quote for 3,000 lbs, but have not received a response after submission.
   - Currently holding 1,000 lbs of bananas without a buyer, creating urgency to find a buyer before spoilage.
   - Despite this setback, committed to continuing the BSS Program until its scheduled end date of March 2025.

2. **Passion Fruit Campaign - 'Passion for Passion Fruit'**:
   - Recognizing growing demand for passion fruit in Trinidad and Grenada, plans to launch a new campaign called "Passion for Passion Fruit."
   - The campaign aims to encourage farmers to plant more passion fruit to meet market demand in the region.

3. **Processed Goods from Guyana**:
   - Continuing efforts to secure cherry juice and other processed products from Guyana, with passion fruit as an important agricultural product.

**Next Steps**:
   - Urgently seek a buyer for the 1,000 lbs of bananas in hand to prevent spoilage.
   - Continue the Banana Supply Stability Program as planned while finding a solution to the current challenge with Foodland Supermarket.
   - Launch the "Passion for Passion Fruit" campaign to encourage farmers to increase passion fruit production.

**Reflection**:
   - The delay with Foodland Supermarket underscores the importance of having backup buyers to prevent inventory spoilage. The passion fruit campaign could help address a gap in the market while reinforcing the goal of becoming the leading trade facilitator in CARICOM.

   - Export and import permit processes are progressing for Trinidad and Grenada.

2. **Passion Fruit Production Decision**:
   - Still in limbo regarding growing passion fruit locally or working with local farmers.

   - Accumulating 1000 seeds to support passion fruit production in both Trinidad and Grenada.

3. **Processed Goods from Guyana**:
   - Focus remains on securing cherry juice and five other processed products from Guyana, with passion fruit as a key agricultural product.

4. **Trade Connections Investigation**:
   - Discovered no trade connection between Grenada and St. Lucia, and nothing major between St. Vincent and Grenada.
   - Investigating potential solutions to facilitate trade between the islands as part of a long-term strategy.

**Next Steps**:
   - Continue the export and import permit processes for the BSS Program.
   - Decide on the approach for passion fruit production in Trinidad and provide seeds to the farmer in Grenada.
   - Begin researching and investigating ways to establish or improve trade connections between Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent.

**Reflection**:
   - Expanding trade between Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent presents a valuable long-term goal that could open up new opportunities. Strategic planning and collaboration with regional stakeholders will be key to overcoming the current lack of trade connections.

## **CARICOM Connects - Company Log Entry**
**Date:** September 17, 2024  
**Lead:** Wholesale TT  
**Source:** Rice and Sugar out of Guyana

**Summary:**
Today, I approached **Wholesale TT** to explore the possibility of sourcing rice and sugar from Guyana. However, I encountered a familiar challenge: **Guyana's manufacturers only deal with contracted distributors in other CARICOM territories**. This is an obstacle I’ve faced before, particularly in Trinidad. Despite this setback, I remain optimistic and determined. I understand that **cross-border transactions are inherently complex** and take time to navigate.

---

**Reflection:**
While the rice and sugar sourcing plan didn’t work out, this experience has reinforced the reality that **trade barriers and exclusive contracts are a significant part of international trade**. Still, I am not deterred. **Adapting to these challenges is key**, and I must pivot towards finding opportunities that aren’t bound by these constraints.

My goal for tomorrow is to **compile a list of unique Guyanese products** that aren’t widely available in Trinidad or other territories. I believe that by identifying these products, I can offer value to **CARICOM Connects members** who are looking to expand their product ranges and source new, distinctive goods.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. **Compile List of Guyanese Products:** Tomorrow, I will dedicate time to identifying **unique products from Guyana** that can be imported into Trinidad and other CARICOM territories. These products should be of high demand and unique to Guyana to give CARICOM Connects members an edge in expanding their offerings.
   
2. **Initiate Import Strategy for Members:** Once the list is complete, I will strategize on how to **import these products for members**, focusing on those looking to diversify and expand their product lines.
   
3. **Portal Development:** I will take the rest of the week off from regular operations to focus on both the **Guyanese product sourcing** and **portal development**. The portal remains a critical part of the overall vision for **CARICOM Connects** and its role in facilitating trade within the region.

4. **Maintain Communication with Wholesale TT:** Even though the rice and sugar opportunity isn’t feasible at this time, I’ll **keep the line of communication open with Wholesale TT**, as they may be interested in other products from Guyana once I’ve compiled the list.

# May 4, 2024: Advancements in Operational Efficiency

## Automation and Method CRM Integration:
In recent weeks, the company has dedicated efforts towards streamlining internal processes, with a particular focus on operational automation. Method CRM has been successfully implemented to manage client procurement orders and lead generation effectively.

## Acquisition of New Leads:
Utilizing the features of Method CRM, the company secured two new leads from Grenada. The first lead, a mechanic, initially sought an engine but opted for a gearbox due to high import taxes. The second lead, a broker, requested a front axle for a Nissan D22, sourced from Japan. Follow-ups have been initiated to ensure client needs are met promptly.

## Cashflow Management Strategies:
While positive feedback has been received for the upcoming brand "Caricom Connects," the company anticipates cash flow challenges due to delayed payments from clients in St. Vincent and Grenada. To address this, arrangements have been made for clients to pay in USD cash, minimizing bank fees. Further strategies are being devised to safely transfer funds back to Trinidad.
## Focus for Operational Optimization:
The company's immediate focus for the next two months will revolve around understanding and customizing Method CRM further. Automation through CRM remains a key strategy for operational efficiency. However, certain critical tasks such as procurement pickup, warehousing, and port handling will retain 100% human input to ensure precision and reliability.

3. Maintain proactive communication with new leads to foster long-term relationships and ensure client satisfaction.
