# Log - January 14, 2024: Ice Cream Base Research

**Key Activities:**

1. **Ice Cream Base Experimentation:**
   - Conducted research on ice cream base formulations using milk.
   - Utilized 10 liters of milk priced at $160 to extract 710ml of heavy cream at a 3:1 cream to milk ratio.

2. **Batch Creation:**
   - Prepared two batches of ice cream base for testing:
     - First batch: 2 parts heavy cream to 1 part granulated sugar.
     - Second batch: 1 part condensed milk, 2 parts heavy cream, and 1 part whole milk.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Observed that the second batch, with condensed milk, heavy cream, and whole milk, resulted in a richer and creamier texture compared to the first batch.
   - Calculated the milk-to-condensed milk ratio to be 2:1, indicating a need for 4 parts milk (1 for heavy cream, 2 for condense milk & 1 for overall dilution) and 1 part heavy cream to create a batch of 946ml of base.

**Next Steps:**
   - Further refine the ice cream base formulation to balance taste and profit margin.
   - Explore variations in ingredients and ratios to optimize flavor and texture.
   - Conduct taste tests and gather feedback to inform final ice cream base selection.
