## 1. Create a Clear Client Trust Account:

- **Create a Bank Account:**
  - Set up a separate bank account in your chart of accounts to track client funds. This could be named something like "Client Trust Account" or "Procurement Funds Account."

## 2. Record the Receipt of Client Funds:

- **Journal Entry:**
  - When the client sends money, record a journal entry to reflect the increase in your client trust account:
    - Debit Client Trust Account
    - Credit Unearned Revenue or Liability Account

## 3. Link the Funds to Specific Clients:

- **Use Customer Names:**
  - Assign each deposit to a specific customer (client) within your accounting software.

## 4. Hold the Funds Until Procurement:

- **Track Funds Separately:**
  - Keep track of the funds separately until they are used for procurement. This helps maintain transparency and ensures that you are using the correct funds for each client.

## 5. Record Procurement Expenses:

- **Create Purchase Transactions:**
  - When you use the funds to procure goods, record the expenses associated with each purchase:
    - Debit Procurement Costs (e.g., cost of goods, shipping fees)
    - Credit Client Trust Account

## 6. Invoice Clients for Procurement Services:

- **Create Invoices:**
  - When the goods are ready, create an invoice for the procurement services rendered:
    - Debit Accounts Receivable (the client owes you)
    - Credit Service Revenue (recognizing the revenue)

## 7. Reconcile Client Trust Account:

- **Regular Reconciliation:**
  - Periodically reconcile your client trust account to ensure it matches the total funds held on behalf of clients.

### Additional Tips:

- **Transparency:**
  - Clearly communicate with clients about how funds are managed and request their approval before utilizing funds for procurement.

- **Documentation:**
  - Keep detailed records of all transactions related to client funds and procurement services.

- **Compliance:**
  - Ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory requirements regarding handling client funds.

- **Accounting Software:**
  - Utilize accounting software features to tag or label transactions related to client funds for easier tracking.
